## DEPLOYMENT

In the Pages Folder you have the code for the different streamlit pages. 

In the Data Folder you have 3 Datasets. Training-Stroke is the dataset where you can train your models (+/- 4000 instances). Testing-Stroke is the dataset where you use your model to predict the probability of making a Stroke (+/- 1000 instances). And sample-submission-testing-stroke is an example of the format for the submission. 

Stroke_Prediction_Project_Home is the file that you run to launch the streamlit multi-page app.

StrokeProject__1 is the original Python file that was used for the training and testing of different models.
